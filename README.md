## Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Working

- **Refresh the page** after installing the extension
- **Check console** for error messages (F12 → Console)
- **Reload extension** at `chrome://extensions`

### No Issues Detected

- Ensure the page has fully loaded before scanning
- Check if the page allows content scripts (some sites block extensions)
- Try scanning a different website to verify functionality

### Highlighting Not Working

- Make sure the element still exists on the page (dynamic content may have changed)
- Refresh the page and re-scan if issues persist

### Report Export Issues

- **PDF not generating?** Check browser console for errors
- **Large pages timing out?** Try exporting as JSON or CSV instead
