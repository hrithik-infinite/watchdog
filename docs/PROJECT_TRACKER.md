## 📝 Notes

### Decisions Made
- Using axe-core for rule detection (hybrid approach)
- shadcn/ui for component library
- Zustand for state management
- Vitest for testing framework
- Focus on quality over quantity (15 rules vs 100+)

### Lessons Learned
- Tailwind CSS v4 layer system critical for utility precedence
- Vision simulators require SVG color matrix filters for accuracy
- TypeScript strict mode catches many issues early
- Comprehensive testing documentation as valuable as tests themselves

### Future Considerations
- AI-powered fix suggestions
- Batch scanning for multiple pages
- CI/CD integration plugins
- Team collaboration features
